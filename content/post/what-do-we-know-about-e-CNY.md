In a white [paper](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/en/3688110/3688172/4157443/4293696/2021071614584691871.pdf "Progress Progress Progress of Research Research Research Research & Development Development Development Development of E-CNY in China") released in July 2021, Peoples Bank Of China Digital Cash Research Institute referred to China's digital yuan as e-CNY. The paper updates on the "Progress on Research and Development of E-CNY in China". It focuses on the motivation and goals of China's CBDC initiative with high level explanations on its operational and technical design. We know e-CNY will adopt a two-layer operational model where PBOC will play a central role as issuer and bookkeeper while selected merchant banks will be authorized operators. In terms of selection of technology roadmap, it does not really give any details but it mentions about "multi-layer security systems and design a data center solution featuring multisite high availability and 24/7 non-stop services". Hmm, does it have anything to do with blockchain, which is the buzz word associated with e-CNY or CBDC in many previous news?

Curious about how e-CNY is designed to work in details, I dug into the internet and found a series of patents filed by the Digital Money Research Institute of PBOC in 2016 and 2017.
